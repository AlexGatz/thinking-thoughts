## Description
   I wanted to come up with a super simple project where I could learn a combination of aspects of web development that I wanted to imporove upon. Also I wanted to learn how to play with next js (which isn't that different than just using react but there certainly are some major differences).

   Essentially, I wanted to learn how to tie together a basic front end that handles stacking components from bottom to top of a cleanly styled page. Each component woudl just be a sort of "post" that contains information stored on a remote database.

   The database is a MongoDB that I will manage and host myself which will be paired with an express js server which will handle authenticaion (again setup myself). I will fetch the data, and use the map function to create a post for each message available in the DB.

   Next, the other major portion of this project is the phone app. Initially I wanted to be able to send a text message to the server that only excepts messages from myself (which I realized could potentially be unsecure still) to populate the DB. Now what I am doing is creating a basic phone app using React-Native that creats a secure session and will beable to post, edit, and delete items on the DB.

   That's pretty much it. It's really just a basic web app, tied the same server as a really basic phone app that all talks to each other.

## What I will learn:
   Next js, Express js, MongoDB, Heroku hosting and deployment, React-Native.

## Why even bother?
   Honestly, I love to learn. I'm a life long learner and truly enjoy the challenge of creating fun little projects to push myself further. This is just a means of tieing together a lot of things I've played with in the past. This is my first "full-stack" project.
